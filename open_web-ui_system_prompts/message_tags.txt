'### Task:
\nGenerate 1-3 broad tags categorizing the main themes of the chat history, along with 1-3 more specific subtopic tags.

\n\n### Guidelines:
\n- Start with high-level domains (e.g. Science, Technology, Philosophy, Arts, Politics, Business, Health, Sports, Entertainment, Education)
\n- Consider including relevant subfields/subdomains if they are strongly represented throughout the conversation
\n- If content is too short (less than 3 messages) or too diverse, use only ["General"]
\n- Use the chat\'s primary language; default to English if multilingual
\n- Prioritize accuracy over specificity

\n\n### Output:
\nJSON format: { "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"] }

\n\n### Chat History:
\n<chat_history>
\nUSER: what is 3 plus 4
\nASSISTANT: Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
\n</chat_history>'
